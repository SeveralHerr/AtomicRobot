# Skills Log

Log of skills that might have been useful for a given response, and why (short form).

## 2026-07-26 — Add logging sections to CLAUDE.md

- `update-config` — flags that "do X at the end of every response" behaviors are memory/prompt conventions, not enforced hooks; relevant caveat, but not used since the user explicitly wanted a CLAUDE.md instruction, not a settings.json hook.

## 2026-07-26 — Add "enhance used skills" rule + merge to main

- No skills were used this turn (plain doc edit + git/GitHub operations); none of the available skills fit small text edits or merging a branch.

## 2026-07-26 — Implement the logging Stop hook

- `update-config` — used to add the Stop hook to `.claude/settings.json` (hooks are the right primitive for a per-turn automated check, not a CLAUDE.md instruction). Enhancement idea, in simple words: give the skill a few ready-made hook recipes (like "warn if file A changed but file B didn't") so it doesn't have to hand-write the shell script from scratch every time.
